# Word Search Generator
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg">
Program that lets you generate a random word search with a set of given words, save the word search to a file, and open/solve word searches from files.

## Description

Creates a random word search using the words given to it by the user. It will generate a random NxN grid depending on the amount of words and the size of the words used. You can save the word search to a file and later open it to view the unsolved or solved puzzle. This project was created in less than 24 hours as a refresher to C++ as it has been a few months since my last use of the language. It was really fun to make, and I would definitely like to improve the algorithm more to generate more fun-looking puzzles.

## Usage
Build and run WordSearch.exe to operate the program. Once open use keyboard characters to navigate the menu.
